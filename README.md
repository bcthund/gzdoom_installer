# gzdoom_installer
## Description
This is a script I created for a system restore procedure during a fresh install. When upgrading from Ubuntu 18.04 to Kubuntu 20.04 I realized that the snap installation of gzdoom no longer worked giving an error about KDialog. I beleive this was due to the virtual environment that snap packages run in.

So I decided to build gzdoom from source but I carefully documented and scripted the steps as part of a larger script that reinstalls all of my common programs and settings.

The script comes with a copy of gzdoom and zmusic sources that were used when the script was created and can compile from those. The script will give you the option to pull the current sources as well which should work as long as dependencies don't change. If the dependencies have changed then the included source should work provided the distribution has all the dependencies requested to be installed by apt, the full list is below.

Each stage of the script will confirm if you want to continue, giving you the option to stop should errors occur. Pressing CTRL+C is captured and will result in the script automatically removing the temporary build directories.

The final step will ask if you want to install the Addons which includes Brutal Doom, high resolution textures, and recomposed music as well as a few other items. You will need to download the Addon zip file from [HERE](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xYo4_OEfLFkCZ7vyHQTBPJ2yC10h0g5g/view?usp=sharing "Download Addons") and extract it into the base folder. You should end up with a './src/gzdoom-src/config' folder. This should be done before starting the gzdoom.sh install script.
